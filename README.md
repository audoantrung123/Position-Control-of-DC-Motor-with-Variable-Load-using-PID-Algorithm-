## 1. Introduction

In modern life, the control of DC motor position with variable load is a topic of broad interest across numerous fields, from industrial manufacturing, automation, and robotics to applications in healthcare and sports. A precise, reliable, and user-friendly DC motor position control system with variable load can improve the efficiency and accuracy of these applications. Therefore, the team decided to research and write a report on this topic. We designed and built a DC motor position control system with variable load using the STM32 microcontroller, combined with a display interface for output response using QT C++. The team focused on the following objectives:

- Designing a DC motor control circuit to achieve high accuracy and stability.
- Designing a user interface to display the output response of the system.
- Designing a variable load mechanism for the system.
- Testing the accuracy and stability of the system.
